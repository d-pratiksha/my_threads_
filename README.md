I have build a full stack Threads clone using Next.js 14+ with a redesigned look transformed from a Figma design, user interaction to community management, technical implementation, and various features, including nested deep comments, notifications, real-time-search, and more.  

If you're getting started and need assistance or face any bugs, join our active Discord community with over 27k+ members. It's a place where people help each other out.
